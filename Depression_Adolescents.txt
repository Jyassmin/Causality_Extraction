Study Objectives: To examine the prospective, reciprocal association between sleep deprivation and depression among adolescents.
Design: A community-based two-wave cohort study.
Setting: A metropolitan area with a population of over 4 million.
Participants: 4,175 youths 11-17 at baseline, and 3,134 of these followed up a year later.
Measurements: Depression is measured using both symptoms of depression and DSM-IV major depression. Sleep deprivation is defined as ≤ 6 h 
of sleep per night.
Results: Sleep deprivation at baseline predicted both measures of depression at follow-up, controlling for depression at baseline. Examining the 
reciprocal association, major depression at baseline, but not symptoms predicted sleep deprivation at follow-up.
Conclusion: These results are the first to document reciprocal effects for major depression and sleep deprivation among adolescents using 
prospective data. The data suggest reduced quantity of sleep increases risk for major depression, which in turn increases risk for decreased sleep.
Keywords: Depression, sleep deprivation, adolescents, epidemiology

INTRODUCTION

Sleep deprivation, or short sleep, is sleep time less that the 
average basal level of about 9 hours per night for adolescents.1 
Studies indicate that many adolescents do not obtain adequate 
nocturnal sleep.2-12 As many as one-fourth of adolescents report 
sleeping 6 hours or less per night.12,13

There is consensus concerning changes in the transition from 
childhood to adolescence that result in increased sleep depriva-
tion in adolescence. Transition to an earlier school start time, 
along with pubertal phase delay, significantly affect the quality 
of  sleep,  sleep-wake  schedule,  and  daytime  behavior.  The 
combination of the phase delay, late-night activities or jobs, and 
early morning school demands can significantly constrict hours 
available to sleep.12,14-17 Laboratory studies using longitudinal designs  have  documented  consistent  changes  in  sleep/wake 
architecture in adolescents.18-20 These changes become particu-
larly pronounced from early to late puberty.21,22

Research  has  been  conducted  on  the  correlates  of  sleep 
disturbance  and  sleep  deprivation  among  adolescents.13-15,23-25 
The available evidence suggests that disturbed sleep and sleep 
deprivation are associated with deficits in functioning across a 
wide  range  of  indicators  of  psychological,  interpersonal,  and 
somatic  well-being.  For  example,  adolescents  with  disturbed 
sleep  report  more  depression,  anxiety,  anger,  inattention  and 
conduct  problems,  drug  and  alcohol  use,  impaired  academic 
performance, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. They also

have  been  reported  to  have  more  fatigue,  less  energy,  worse 
perceived  health,  and  symptoms  such  as  headaches,  stomach 
aches,  and  backaches.  Laboratory  studies  in  particular  have 
documented  impaired  cognitive  function,  daytime  sleepiness, 
and fatigue as a consequence of sleep deprivation.14,21,22

However, almost all of the epidemiologic data on these asso-
ciations  emanate  from  prevalence  or  cross-sectional  surveys. 
Thus, the question of whether, for example, sleep deprivation 
increases the risk of functional impairment among adolescents, 
or emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal problems increase 
the risk of sleep deprivation, remains unclear.

Roberts  et  al.  examined  the  effects  of  deep  deprivation 
among adolescents and found that short sleep (≤ 6 h) increased 
subsequent risk for school problems, low life satisfaction, poor 
perceive health, depressed mood, drug use, and poor grades.24 
Other studies also have found that sleep problems, including 
sleep  deprivation,  increased  the  odds  of  subsequent  mental 
health problems,6,26-29 including depressed mood.

Clearly,  there  appears  to  be  an  association  between  short 
sleep duration and symptoms of depressed mood. Again, while 
much  of  this  evidence  is  from  cross-sectional  or  prevalence 
studies, prospective or longitudinal studies also find short sleep 
increases risk for disturbed mood. However, to our knowledge, 
there are few data relating to the converse, i.e., that depressed 
mood increases risk for short sleep. Roberts et al. report that 
depressed mood (symptoms of depression) at baseline did not 
increase risk of restricted sleep (≤ 6 h) a year later.13

But  what  about  the  association  between  short  sleep  dura-
tion  and  clinical  depression  (e.g.,  major  depression)?  There 
is an extensive literature on the association between insomnia 
and  major  depression,  particularly  among  adults,30-34  as  well 
as  some  data  on  adolescents.35-37  The  evidence  indicates  that 
insomnia, particularly chronic insomnia, increases subsequent 
risk of major depression. The evidence thus far, albeit limited, 
suggests that major depression confers little risk for developing

risk of major depression, but the reverse was not true.38 But, to 
our knowledge, no study to date has examined the prospective 
association  between  sleep  deprivation  and  major  depression 
among adolescents.

That  was  the  focus  of  our  research.  We  examined  the 
prospective association between short sleep or sleep depriva-
tion and major depression in adolescence. Using data from a 
two-wave cohort study of youths 11-17 years at baseline, Teen 
Health 2000 (TH2K), we examined the reciprocal association 
between short sleep and major depression, e.g., whether short 
sleep  increases  the  risk  for  major  depression,  whether  major 
depression increases the risk for short sleep, whether the asso-
ciation is asymmetric, or whether there is an association at all. 
The answers to this question have both etiologic and clinical 
implications. If there are reciprocal effects, then each partially 
accounts for the other in a causal way. Understanding the epide-
miology of one requires understanding the other. On the other 
hand, if there is bi-directionality, clinically the presence of one 
suggests  assessment  and  intervention  for  the  other.  We  may 
need to focus on both for optimal effect.

METHODS

Sample

The  sample  was  selected  from  households  in  the  Houston 
metropolitan  area  enrolled  in  two  local  health  maintenance 
organizations.  One  youth,  aged  11  to  17  years,  was  sampled 
from each eligible household, oversampling for ethnic minority 
households. Initial recruitment was by telephone contact with 
parents. A brief screener was administered on ethnic status of 
the sample youths and to confirm data on age and sex of youths. 
Every household with a child 11 to 17 years of age was eligible. 
Because there were proportionately fewer minority subscriber 
households,  sample  weights  were  developed  and  adjusted  by 
post-stratification  to  reflect  the  age,  ethnic,  and  sex  distribu-
tion of the 5-county Houston metropolitan area in 2000. The 
precision of estimates are thereby improved and sample selec-
tion bias reduced to the extent that it is related to demographic 
composition.39 Thus, the weighted estimates generalize to the 
population  11  to  17  years  of  age  in  a  metropolitan  area  of 
4.7 million people.

Data were collected on sample youths and one adult care-
giver  using  computer-assisted  personal  interviews  and  self-
administered  questionnaires.  The  computerized 
interview 
contained the structured psychiatric interview (see below) and 
demographic data on the youths and the household. Height and 
weight  measures  were  conducted  after  the  completion  of  the 
interviews. The interviews and measurements were conducted 
by trained lay interviewers. The interviews took on average 1 to 
2 h, depending on the number of psychiatric problems present. 
Interviews, questionnaires, and measurements were completed 
with 4,175 youths at baseline, representing 66% of the eligible 
households.  There  were  no  significant  differences  among 
ethnic groups in completion rates. Youths and caregivers were 
followed  up  approximately  12  months  later,  using  the  same 
assessment  battery  used  at  baseline.  The  cohort  consisted  of 
3,134  youths  plus  their  caregivers  in Wave  2  (75%  of Wave 
1 dyads). All youths and parents gave written informed consent 

prior  to  participation.  All  study  forms  and  procedures  were 
approved  by  the  University  of  Texas  Health  Science  Center 
Committee for Protection of Human Subjects.

Measures

Depression

Depression  was  measured  using  two  alternate  strategies. 
We examined major depression, defined as a major depressive 
episode in the previous 12 months (prevalence was 1.7%) using 
DSM-IV  criteria  and  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health 
(NIMH) Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version 
IV (DISC-IV) as the diagnostic instrument.44 Then, given that 
much of the literature has focused on symptoms of depression, 
we examine disturbed mood in the past 12 months, defined as 
depressed mood, irritable mood, or anhedonia (baseline preva-
lence was 57.6%).

Data  on  psychiatric  disorders  were  collected  using  the 
youth version of the DISC-IV, a highly structured instrument 
with  demonstrated  reliability  and  validity.44  Interviews  were 
conducted by college-educated lay interviewers who had been 
extensively  trained  using  protocols  provided  by  Columbia 
University.41,42 Interviews with the DISC-IV were administered 
using laptop computers.

Sleep Deprivation

The DISC-IV does not inquire about symptoms of insomnia 
other than in the context of other DSM-IV disorders (such as 
mood  or  anxiety  disorders). To  supplement  the  DISC-IV,  we 
inquired about symptoms of disturbed sleep, focusing primarily 
on symptoms of insomnia, their frequency and duration. Two 
questions inquired about hours of sleep on average the subject 
experienced on weeknights during the past 4 weeks and also 
on  weekend  nights.  Six  hours  or  less  was  defined  as  short 
sleep duration or deprivation,3,23,41 following the lead of earlier 
studies. That is, short sleep was defined 2 ways: ≤ 6 h only on 
weeknights and ≤ 6 h on both weeknights and weekend nights. 
The sleep items were taken from a variety of validated sleep 
questionnaires, including SleepEVAL.42,45

Covariates

We include as covariates known correlates of both depres-
sion  and  sleep:  age,  gender,  and  family  income.  Family 
income was assessed using total household income in the past 
year: < $35,000, $35,000 - $64,999, and $65,000 or more. Age 
was assessed by age at most recent birthdate: 12 or less, 13-15, 
and 16 or older. Table 1 presents characteristics of the sample 
and cohort. As can be seen, the sample is diverse. In terms of 
hours of sleep, about 20% slept ≤ 6 h on weeknights. About 9% 
slept ≤ 6 h every night.

Analyses

First,  the  relationship  between  sleep  deprivation  on  week-
nights or both weeknights and weekends and depression (yes, 
no)  at  Wave  1  was  examined,  calculating  crude  odds  ratios 
and then adjusted odds ratios controlling for age, gender, and 
family income. Second, sleep deprivation at Wave 1 was used 
to  predict  depression  at  Wave  2,  first  examining  crude  odds 
ratios  and  then  adjusted  odds  ratios  controlling  for  the  same 

240

SLEEP, Vol. 37, No. 2, 2014Sleep Deprivation and Adolescent Depression—Roberts et alcovariates. We also controlled for depression at baseline, either 
major  depression  or  symptoms,  depending  on  the  focus.  We 
then repeated this strategy using depression at Wave 1 to predict 
sleep deprivation at Wave 2, controlling for sleep at Wave 1.

The estimated odds ratios and their 95% confidence limits 
were calculated using survey logistic regression (Proc Survey-
logistic) procedures in SAS V9.146 and Taylor series approxima-
tion to compute the standard error of the odds ratio. Lepkowski 
and Bowles47 have indicated that the difference in computing 
standard error between this method and other repeated replica-
tion methods such as the jackknife is very small.

RESULTS

Table  2  presents  results  for  the  association  between  sleep 
deprivation and depression at baseline. Short sleep consistently 
was  associated  with  depression,  both  major  depression  and 
depressive symptoms, although the effect was less robust for 
symptoms.

In Table 3, the same prospective association was observed 
for sleep deprivation and both measures of depression. Adjust-
ment for covariates affects the associations, but all were still 
significant (P < 0.05). Again, the effect is stronger for major 
depression than for symptoms.

When  we  examined  the  reverse  prospective  association  in 
Table 4, there was increased risk for short sleep among those 
depressed at baseline. However, after controlling for covariates, 
only one association remained significant—major depression at 
baseline increased risk of sleep deprivation only on weeknights.

DISCUSSION

We found that sleep deprivation, defined as 6 hours or less 
on  weeknights  and  every  night  (including  weekends)  and 
symptoms of depression covary at baseline. In this regard, our 

results are consistent with the literature, which largely is based 
on cross-sectional research. When we examined whether sleep 
deprivation at baseline increased risk of depressive symptoms

at follow-up, we found a 25% to 38% increased risk. This is 
similar to previous studies.23,24,27

However, when we looked at reciprocal effects, depressive 
symptoms predicting sleep deprivation, we found no associa-
tion.  Similar  results  have  been  reported  for  insomnia  among 
youths35 as well as for depressed mood.13 The latter paper was 
based on the same data used here, Teen Health 2000.

When we turned to the association between sleep depriva-
tion and major depression, we found the two were correlated 
at  baseline.  We  also  found  that  baseline  sleep  deprivation 
increased  risk  for  subsequent  major  depression,  by  a  factor 
of more than 3. This association was much stronger than for 
depressive symptoms, as noted above. When we examined the 
reciprocal association, controlling for covariates, the odds were 
1.95 (n.s.) for sleep deprivation every night, but 4.28 (P < 0.05) 
for  sleep  deprivation  on  weeknights.  While  not  statistically 
significant, an odds of almost 2 is not trivial, but power is prob-
lematic given the low prevalence of major depression.

Limitations

As noted earlier, our sleep items asked whether subjects had 
experienced symptoms almost every day for the past 4 weeks. 
Therefore,  our  results  are  limited,  in  that  we  could  not  date 
onset and thus were not able to partition our sample into those 
with acute versus long-term sleep deprivation. In a recent paper, 
Buysse et al.48 found differential results related to duration of 
insomnia  among  young  adults.  In  their  epidemiologic  study 
in the United Kingdom, Ohayon et al.49 found that the median 
duration of insomnia symptoms was 24 months. We could not 
examine  whether  risk-factor  profiles  differed  for  those  with 
sleep disturbance of shorter and longer duration (> 24 months), 
although  it  might  be  expected  that  the  association  with 
somatic, psychological, and interpersonal functioning would be 
pronounced for chronic sleep problems of longer duration.

Another limitation is that we did not have objective data on 
disturbed sleep. That is, we did not have physiologic studies. 
While such data would be useful to have, self-reports and inter-
view-based measures remain the measures of choice in commu-
nity surveys. Our study was no exception. We should note that 
there are data suggesting that subjective measures of sleep from 
children and adolescents are modestly correlated with objective 
measures of disturbed sleep.50 We should note as well that the 
use of laboratory measures are impractical in large field studies 
such as TH2K.5,7 We should note that studies have shown that 
youths with MDD report subjective sleep disturbance that is not 
accompanied by objective indicators of disturbed sleep.51

We  also  should  note  that  although  our  sleep  assessment 
inquired  about  symptoms  experienced  in  the  past  4  weeks, 
this involved retrospective recall. Use of sleep diaries would 
have provided daily data on sleep symptoms, but are difficult to 
employ in large, community-based epidemiologic surveys such 
as TH2K.

Questions might arise about our sample design. We did not 
employ  an  area  probability  design.  To  compensate  for  this 
design effect, we post-stratified our sample to approximate the 
age,  gender,  and  ethnic  composition  of  the  population  11  to 
17 years. Our weighted sample closely approximated the age, 
gender, and ethnic composition of the five-county metropolitan 
area.  Our  follow-up  rate  was  75%,  which  raises  the  issue  of 
potential  bias.  However,  in  a  previous  paper,43  data  demon-
strated our Wave 1 sample and the baseline data for the Wave 
1 – Wave 2 cohort were highly comparable, indicating little bias 
in rates of psychiatric disorders including depression was intro-
duced by attrition. There also was no bias evident in prevalence 
rates for short sleep in Wave 1 and 2.

We also did not interview parents about either sleep distur-
bance  or  depression  in  their  adolescents.  Although  there  is 
argument  that  data  from  multiple  informants  are  desirable, 
many  studies  have  demonstrated  considerable  discordance  is 
parent-child reports of youth problems.52,53 We used data only 
from youths.

CONCLUSIONS

We  are  the  first  to  examine  the  prospective  association 
between sleep deprivation and major depression in adolescents. 
We also are the first to directly investigate whether there is a 
reciprocal effect.

We find that sleep deprivation has a strong effect on risk for 
major depression, increasing risk 4- to 5-fold in crude analyses 
and 3-fold in multivariate analyses controlling for depression 
at baseline. Sleep deprivation also increased risk of depressive 
symptoms, but the effect, while significant, was greatly attenu-
ated compared to major depression.

When  we  examined  the  reverse,  the  results  were  quite 
different.  There  was  no  increased  risk  of  sleep  deprivation 
among those with depressive symptoms. There was an effect for 
major depression but this was limited to sleep deprivation only 
on weeknights. It may be that since major depression impairs 
functioning  in  multiple  life  domains,40  and  the  combination 
of phase delay, late night activities or jobs and early morning 
school demands during weekdays and weeknights12,14,17 further 
restrict sleep, that this explains in part this association.

242

SLEEP, Vol. 37, No. 2, 2014Sleep Deprivation and Adolescent Depression—Roberts et alThese results, particularly for major depression, suggest that 
quantity of sleep, following DSM-IV guidelines40 increases risk 
for major depression, which in turn increases risk for decreased 
sleep. This is not surprising, given the phenomenology of both 
sleep disturbances and major depression. DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria  for  major  depression  focus  on  insomnia  (insufficient 
sleep) or hypersomnia (sleeping too much), hence enhancing 
the likelihood of major depression increasing subsequent risk 
of short sleep duration.

Our results extend the available data on sleep and depres-
sion and are the first prospective data on this question. Clearly 
more data are needed on the prospective reciprocal association 
between  these  major  public  health  problems  in  adolescence. 
In  particular,  our  results  need  to  be  replicated  in  different 
geographic and ethnocultural populations in the United States 
as  well  as  cross-nationally.  While  our  results  for  sleep  and 
psychiatric  disorder8,24  appear  comparable  to  other  studies, 
the sample was drawn from one large metropolitan area in the 
Southwest, and generalizability or external validity is always 
a concern. What is needed as well are studies which examine 
developmental trajectories of sleep and depression from child-
hood through adolescence into adulthood.
